                    <h2>Dear Santa,</h2>
                    <p>
                        This year I want a very different gift for Christmas.<br>
                        Every past year, it took my family so much time to organise the holiday events.<br>
                        There were so many phone calls, so much chaos and eventually people still forgot what they were supposed to do or bring. <br>
                        I still haven't forgiven uncle Bob for not bringing his famous gingerbread cookies!<br>
                        <br>
                        For that reason, I want my present to be one of your elves, so they can help us with the events.<br>
                        Preferrably, he could make a list of all our family events and show them on a shared board.<br>
                        On that board, I also want to have what food will be present. It is important to have the right expectations, you know.<br>
                        That way, each person could tell the elf what they will bring to the event and the elf will note it.<br>
                        <br>
                        This would help everyone enjoy Christmas so much more. <br>
                        <br>
                        Yours sincerely, <br>
                        A big fan<br>
                        <br>
                        P.S. If none of your elves are available, a PlayStation 5 will do.
